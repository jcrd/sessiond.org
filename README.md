## Overview

sessiond is a standalone X session manager that reports the idle status of a
graphical session to **systemd-logind**. It can be used alongside a window
manager or desktop environment that does not provide its own session management.

## Features

* automatic screen locking on session idle and before sleeping
* automatic backlight dimming on session idle
* systemd targets activated by systemd-logind's lock, unlock, sleep,
  and shutdown signals
* hooks triggered by inactivity or signals
* a DBus service
* (optional) management of DPMS settings

## Packages

* **RPM** package available from [copr][3]. [![Copr build status](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/jcrd/sessiond/package/sessiond/status_image/last_build.png)](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/jcrd/sessiond/package/sessiond/)

  Install with:
  ```
  dnf copr enable jcrd/sessiond
  dnf install sessiond
  ```

## Configuration

sessiond looks for a configuration file at
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sessiond/sessiond.conf`
or falls back to `$HOME/.config/sessiond/sessiond.conf` if `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`
is unset.

The default configuration is included at `/usr/share/sessiond/sessiond.conf`.

See [sessiond.conf(5)](man/sessiond.conf.5.md) for descriptions of the options.

### Hooks

Hook files with the `.hook` suffix are read from
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sessiond/hooks.d` or `$HOME/.config/sessiond/hooks.d`.

Hooks provide functionality similar to systemd targets but can also be triggered
by a period of inactivity.

See [sessiond-hooks(5)](man/sessiond-hooks.5.md) for more information.

## DBus service

sessiond provides a DBus service on the session bus at the well-known name
**_org.sessiond.session1_**.

See the _DBus Service_ section of [sessiond(1)](man/sessiond.1.md#dbus-service)
for descriptions of methods, properties, and signals.

For complete introspection data, use **gdbus**:

```
gdbus introspect --session --dest org.sessiond.session1 --object-path /org/sessiond/session1
```

### sessionctl

The `sessionctl` script is provided to run a sessiond session and interact with
its DBus service.

```
usage: sessionctl [-h]
                  {run,stop,status,lock,unlock,properties,backlight,version}
                  ...

With no arguments, show session status.

positional arguments:
  {run,stop,status,lock,unlock,properties,backlight,version}
    run                 Run session
    stop                Stop the running session
    status              Show session status
    lock                Lock the session
    unlock              Unlock the session
    properties          List session properties
    backlight           Interact with backlights
    version             Show sessiond version

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
```

See [sessionctl(1)](man/sessionctl.1.md) for more information.

## systemd targets

sessiond provides the following systemd targets:

Target                    | Started when
------                    | ------------
`graphical-lock.target`   | session is locked
`graphical-unlock.target` | session is unlocked
`graphical-idle.target`   | session becomes idle
`graphical-unidle.target` | session resumes activity
`user-sleep.target`       | system sleeps
`user-shutdown.target`    | system shuts down

## Managing the session

### Starting the session

A sessiond-based session should be started via a display manager, using
the provided `sessiond.desktop` X session file.

For example, configure `lightdm` to start a sessiond session by setting
`user-session=sessiond` in `/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf`.

### Running services

`sessiond-session.target` binds to `graphical-session.target` provided
by systemd. See the _Special Passive User Units_ section of
[systemd.special(7)][2] for more information about graphical sessions.

To run a service in the graphical session, `<service>.service` should contain:

```
[Unit]
PartOf=graphical-session.target
```

so the service is stopped when the session ends, and:

```
[Install]
WantedBy=graphical-session.target
```

so the service is started when the session begins.

It can then be enabled with `systemctl --user enable <service>`.

See below for example services.

### Locking the session

By default, the session is locked when it becomes idle and before sleeping.
This is configured in the `[Lock]` section of the configuration file.
The session can be manually locked by running `sessionctl lock`.

To configure a service to act as the screen locker, include:

```
[Service]
ExecStopPost=/usr/bin/sessionctl unlock
```

so the session is considered unlocked when the locker exits, and:

```
[Install]
WantedBy=graphical-lock.target
```

so the service is started when the session locks. Then enable it.

Below is an example `i3lock.service`:

```
[Unit]
Description=Lock X session with i3lock
PartOf=graphical-session.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/i3lock -n -c 000000
ExecStopPost=/usr/bin/sessionctl unlock

[Install]
WantedBy=graphical-lock.target
```

### Stopping the session

The session can be stopped with `sessionctl stop`. This will stop
`graphical-session.target` and all units that are part of the session.

A service that is part of the graphical session can be responsible for stopping
the session. To configure a service to stop the session when it exits, include:

```
[Service]
ExecStopPost=/usr/bin/sessionctl stop
```

Below is an example `awesome.service` that stops the session when the Awesome
window manager exits:

```
[Unit]
Description=Awesome window manager
PartOf=graphical-session.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/awesome
ExecStopPost=/usr/bin/sessionctl stop

[Install]
WantedBy=graphical-session.target
```
### Inhibiting inactivity

Inhibitor locks can be acquired when the session should be considered active
while a given command is running, e.g. a media player.

The `sessiond-inhibit` script provides a simple interface to acquire a lock
before running a command and release it when the command returns.

```
usage: sessiond-inhibit [-h] [-w WHO] [-y WHY] [command]

With no command, list running inhibitors.

positional arguments:
  command            Command to run

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -w WHO, --who WHO  Set who is inhibiting
  -y WHY, --why WHY  Set why this inhibitor is running
```

See [sessiond-inhibit(1)](man/sessiond-inhibit.1.md) for more information.

See the _DBus Service_ section of [sessiond(1)](man/sessiond.1.md#dbus-service)
for descriptions of inhibitor-related methods.

## Building

### Dependencies

* [meson][1] >= 0.47.0 [*build*]
* perl [*build*]
* glib >= 2.52 [*build*]
* libx11 [*build*]
* libxi [*build*]
* libxext (optional, for DPMS support) [*build*]
* python3-setuptools [*build*]
* python3 [*runtime*]
* dbus-python [*runtime*]

Ensure the above build dependencies are satisfied and configure the build with
**meson**:

```
meson builddir && cd builddir
```

Inside the build directory, `meson configure` will list all options set with
`-D`. For example, to disable the DPMS feature, run:

```
meson configure -Ddpms=disabled
```

Finally, run `ninja` to build sessiond.

### Testing

Run tests with `meson test`.

### Installing

After building sessiond, `ninja install` can be used to install it.

The `sessiond` Python package must also be installed. Run:
```
cd python-sessiond
python3 setup.py install
```
